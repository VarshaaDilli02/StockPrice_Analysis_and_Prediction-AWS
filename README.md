# StockPrice_Analysis_and_Prediction-AWS

Stock market prediction and analysis are some of the most difficult jobs to complete. There are numerous causes for this, including market volatility and a variety of other dependent and independent variables that influence the value of a certain stock in the market. This project will walk through a simple implementation of analyzing and forecasting the stock prices of a Popular Worldwide Online Retail Store in Python using various Machine Learning Algorithms.

AIM:

To load the Amazon Stock Price dataset to HDFS, implement suitable queries in PIG and HIVE to analyse the Amazon Stock Price dataset and make predictions on the stock market using a appropriate Machine Learning Model to forecast the stock values. 


DATASET:

•	The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle.

•	The attributes include date, high price, low price, opening price, closing price, volume, adjusted closing price. 


TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES USED:

•	Pyspark

•	Pig

•	Hive


CONCEPTS USED:

•	ML model - LSTM

•	Querying in Pig & Hive

FUTURE SCOPE:

To compare the results with many other machine learning models and test their differences.
