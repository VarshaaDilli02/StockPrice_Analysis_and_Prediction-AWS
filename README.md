# StockPrice_Analysis_and_Prediction-AWS

Stock market prediction and analysis are some of the most difficult jobs to complete. There are numerous causes for this, including market volatility and a variety of other dependent and independent variables that influence the value of a certain stock in the market. This project will walk through a simple implementation of analyzing and forecasting the stock prices of a Popular Worldwide Online Retail Store in Python using various Machine Learning Algorithms.

**Aim:**

To analyse the stock prices over the years through the AWS dataset and estimate the stock value using one of the best machine learning model.
